Excellent — here’s a concise plan and what I’ve implemented to match your goals.

Executor “opt‑out by default”

- Behavior: The MCP server now autostarts the background executor loop by default
(opt‑out). It checks and delivers due prompts for all agents, continuously.
- How it works:
    - Default: PROMPTYOSELF_EXECUTOR_AUTOSTART defaults to true.
    - Disable (opt‑out): export PROMPTYOSELF_EXECUTOR_AUTOSTART=false (or pass no
autostart flags and override env).
    - Interval: PROMPTYOSELF_EXECUTOR_INTERVAL (default 60 seconds).

Executor status tool

- New MCP tool: promptyoself_executor_status
    - Returns: { status: "ok", running: bool, interval: int|null }
    - Lets you quickly verify the loop is running and what its interval is.

Systemd unit (template)

- I recommend a simple systemd service for the MCP server with the executor loop enabled.
Here’s a unit you can drop into /etc/systemd/system/promptyoself-mcp.service on your MCP
host:

[Unit]
Description=PromptYoSelf MCP Server (FastMCP) with Executor
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/promptyoself
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash -lc './start.sh http --host tailscale --port 8000 --path /mcp
--executor --executor-interval 60'
Environment=LETTA_BASE_URL=http://100.126.136.121:8283

# Optional: if the MCP needs Letta auth envs for upload

# Environment=LETTA_SERVER_PASSWORD=...

# Optional agent defaults for inference

# Environment=LETTA_AGENT_ID=agent-1a4a5989-ab98-478f-9b1f-bbece814ed7a

Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

- Enable and start:
    - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    - sudo systemctl enable promptyoself-mcp
    - sudo systemctl start promptyoself-mcp
- This will:
    - Bind to your Tailscale IP (start.sh resolves when host=tailscale).
    - Start the executor loop automatically.
    - Restart on boot or crash.

Deployment guidance

- Separate VPS vs same VPS:
    - Compute: The MCP server + executor are lightweight unless you expect very high
schedule volume. Running on the same VPS as Letta is acceptable for most cases; separation
is nice for isolation (and if you anticipate spikes or want independent scaling), but
not required.
    - Network: You’ve already placed Letta on 100.126.136.121 and MCP on 100.76.47.25 —
this is a good pattern.
- Dockerization:
    - Recommended for long-term ops: a small Dockerfile to wrap this server (with
healthcheck, envs) is straightforward and works well under Compose or systemd.
    - For now, your systemd + start.sh approach is perfectly fine and easy to maintain.

Tests (added)
- I added unit tests to cover the new executor functionality:
    - tests/unit/test_executor_autostart.py:
    - Verifies that autostart defaults to true (spawns a background process).
    - Verifies autostart can be disabled explicitly.
executor status tool and autostart behavior are now explicitly covered by unit tests.

Your two‑minute “live” test

- With the executor enabled (opt‑out default), the backend delivers due prompts to all
agents. You no longer need the agent to call promptyoself_execute.
- If you want, I can remotely:
    - Enable the executor on your MCP host via start.sh or systemd.
    - Send a confirmation message to the agent when its scheduled message fires.

What I changed in the repo

- promptyoself_mcp_server.py:
    - Autostart default flipped to true (opt‑out by env).
    - New tool promptyoself_executor_status.
    - CLI arg fixes (--autostart-executor, --executor-interval).
- start.sh:
    - Added --executor and --executor-interval flags that propagate to the server.
- Docs:
    - README.md, docs/letta-integration.md, docs/promptyoself-tools.md, AGENTS.md,
CLAUDE.md updated with practical managed-MCP ops, executor loop enablement, auth notes,
and Tailscale URLs.
- Tests:
    - Added tests/unit/test_executor_autostart.py.

Want me to wire the systemd unit on your MCP VPS and flip it on now? I can also check
the executor status via the new tool and ping your agent after the next due delivery to
confirm.
